  <string name="CrowdinId:3142">&lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3144">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3146">of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3148">Preamble</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3150">The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3152">software and other kinds of works.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3154">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3156">to take away your freedom to share and change the works.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3158">By contrast,</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3160">the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3162">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3164">software for all its users.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3166">We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3168">GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3170">any other work released this way by its authors.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3172">You can apply it to</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3174">your programs, too.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3176">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3178">price.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3180">Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3182">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3184">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3186">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3188">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3190">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3192">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3194">Therefore, you have</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3196">certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3198">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3200">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3202">gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3204">freedoms that you received.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3206">You must make sure that they, too, receive</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3208">or can get the source code.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3210">And you must show them these terms so they</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3212">know their rights.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3214">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3216">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3218">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3220">For the developers\' and authors\' protection, the GPL clearly explains</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3222">that there is no warranty for this free software.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3224">For both users\' and</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3226">authors\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3228">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3230">authors of previous versions.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3232">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3234">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3236">can do so.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3238">This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3240">protecting users\' freedom to change the software.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3242">The systematic</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3244">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3246">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3248">Therefore, we</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3250">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3252">products.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3254">If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3256">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3258">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3260">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3262">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3264">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3266">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3268">make it effectively proprietary.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3270">To prevent this, the GPL assures that</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3272">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3274">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3276">modification follow.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3278">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3280">0.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3282">Definitions.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3284">\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3286">\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3288">works, such as semiconductor masks.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3290">\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3292">License.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3294">Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3296">\"Licensees\" and</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3298">\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3300">To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3302">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3304">exact copy.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3306">The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3308">earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3310">A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3312">on the Program.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3314">To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3316">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3318">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3320">computer or modifying a private copy.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3322">Propagation includes copying,</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3324">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3326">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3328">To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3330">parties to make or receive copies.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3332">Mere interaction with a user through</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3334">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3336">An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3338">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3340">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3342">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3344">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3346">If</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3348">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3350">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3352">1.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3354">Source Code.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3356">The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3358">for making modifications to it.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3360">\"Object code\" means any non-source</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3362">form of a work.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3364">A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3366">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3368">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3370">is widely used among developers working in that language.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3372">The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3374">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3376">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3378">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3380">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3382">implementation is available to the public in source code form.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3384">A</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3386">\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3388">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3390">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3392">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3394">The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3396">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3398">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3400">control those activities.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3402">However, it does not include the work\'s</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3404">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3406">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3408">which are not part of the work.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3410">For example, Corresponding Source</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3412">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3414">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3416">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3418">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3420">subprograms and other parts of the work.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3422">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3424">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3426">Source.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3428">The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3430">same work.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3432">2.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3434">Basic Permissions.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3436">All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3438">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3440">conditions are met.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3442">This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3444">permission to run the unmodified Program.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3446">The output from running a</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3448">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</string>

  <string name="CrowdinId:3462">You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3464">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</string>

  <string name="CrowdinId:3490">Protecting Users\' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3492">No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3494">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3496">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</string>

  <string name="CrowdinId:3506">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</string>

  <string name="CrowdinId:3518">Conveying Verbatim Copies.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3520">You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\'s source code as you</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3522">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</string>

  <string name="CrowdinId:3572">regardless of how they are packaged.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3574">This License gives no</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3576">permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3578">invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:3580">d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</string>

  <string name="CrowdinId:4342">If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4344">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4346">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4348">To do so, attach the following notices to the program.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4350">It is safest</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4352">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4354">state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</string>
