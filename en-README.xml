  <string name="CrowdinId:4436">(Legally!)</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4438">The code scrapes course links and coupons from
[tutorialbar.com](https://tutorialbar.com)</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4440">**_Disclaimer &amp; WARNINGS:_**</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4442">**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you **clear all saved Debit/Credit Card or any other
   saved payment info from your Browser &amp; your Udemy account** before using the
   script!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4444">**Use** this ONLY for **Educational Purposes!** By using this code you agree
   that **I\'m not responsible for any kind of trouble** caused by the code.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4446">**Make sure web-scraping is legal in your region.**</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4448">This is **NOT a hacking script**, i.e., it can\'t enroll you for a specific
   course!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4450">Instead it finds courses that provide coupon links to make the
   transaction free and then LEGALLY enroll you to the course!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4452">Requirements:</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4454">How to Install the Requirements?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4456">**Required Python version:** [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4458">**You must have pip installed.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4460">Please look up how to install pip in your OS.**</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4462">Download a release of this project or clone the repository then navigate to the
folder where you placed the files on.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4464">Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to
get all the requirements installed in one go.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4466">**Webdrivers are now automatically installed!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4468">But here are some links in case
  you are using the vanilla script or the Safari Browser:**</string>

  <string name="CrowdinId:4488">Make sure to install all the requirements above.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4490">Run the script and the cli will guide you through the settings required</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4492">Otherwise you can rename the following file
[sample_settings.yaml](sample_settings.yaml) to **settings.py** and edit it
  using a text editor and insert your **Udemy registered email in the email
  section**, your **Udemy password in the password section**, and the **ZIP Code
  in the zipcode section (if you reside in the United States or any other region
  where Udemy asks for ZIP Code as Billing Info, else enter a random number)**.</string>

  <string name="CrowdinId:4524">3 .</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4526">Run the chosen script in terminal like so:
`python udemy_enroller_firefox.py`</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4528">4 .</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4530">The bot starts scraping the course links from the first **All Courses** page
on [Tutorial Bar](https://www.tutorialbar.com/all-courses/page/1) and starts
enrolling you to Udemy courses.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4532">After it has enrolled you to courses from the
first page, it then moves to the next Tutorial Bar page and the cycle continues.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4534">Stop the script by pressing ctrl+c in terminal to stop the enrollment process.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4536">FAQs</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4538">1.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4540">Can I get a specific course for free with this script?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4542">Unfortunately no, but let me assure you that you may be lucky enough to get a
particular course for free when the instructor posts it\'s coupon code in order
to promote it.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4544">Also, over time you would build a library of courses by running
the script often and have all the required courses in your collection.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4546">In fact,
I made this course after completing a
[Python automation course](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/) and selenium,
which of course I got for free!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4548">:)</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4550">2.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4552">How does the bot work?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4554">The bot retrieves coupon links from Tutorial Bar\'s list to cut the prices and
then uses Selenium\'s Browser automation features to login and enroll to the
courses.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4556">Think of it this way: Epic Games &amp; other clients like Steam provide you
a handful of games each week, for free; Only in this case, we need a coupon code
to make those courses free.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4558">3.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4560">How frequently should you run the script?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4562">Daily, at least once!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4564">If you are using it for the first time, I recommend that
you allow it to scrape through all pages on Tutorial Bar (might take a few hours
since there are &gt;500 pages on the site).</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4566">I\'ve painstakingly amassed over 4000
courses in the last four years!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4568">And out of those 4000, I\'ve only paid for 4 of
these courses.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4570">So, a mere **0.001%** of courses are **actually paid** in my collection!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4572">Thankfully, you can get more than what I gathered in 4 years, in a matter of
weeks!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4574">üôåüèª</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4576">4.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4578">Why did I create this?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4580">It used to be my daily habit to redeem courses and it was an extremely tedious
task that took around 15 minutes, for 10 courses.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4582">And then I suddenly got the
idea to automate it, after I found the automation course mentioned above.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4584">I bet,
it will save your precious time too!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4586">:)</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4588">5.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4590">Udemy has detected that I\'m using automation tools to browse the website!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4592">What should I do?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4594">![](https://i.imgur.com/pwseilE.jpg) Relax!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4596">This happens when you run the script
several times in a short interval of time.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4598">Solve the captcha, close the browser,
and simply re-run the script.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4600">Easy peasy lemon squeezy!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4602">üçãüôÉ <br></br><br></br></string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4604">6.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4606">The code compiles successfully but it\'s taking too long to work!</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4608">IS there any way to fix that?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4610">Since we are heavily dependent on a third-party site to retrieve coupons links,
there may be issues when the site is down.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4612">Needless to mention the connectivity
issues too.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4614">If everything is working fine, you can see the courses being
retrieved in the Python console/shell, which may take a while.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4616">7.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4618">Which is the best way to run the script?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4620">It is recommended to run the script using Python\'s IDLE IDE.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4622">**Pro-tip:** Create a batch file, to launch the script instantly, using these
instructions: https://datatofish.com/batch-python-script/</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4624">8.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4626">Which branch to commit against?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4628">Pull request should be made on \"develop\" branch.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4630">9.</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4632">What\'s the roadmap?</string>
  <string name="CrowdinId:4634">Take a look at our
[Roadmap here](https://github.com/aapatre/Automatic-Udemy-Course-Enroller-GET-PAID-UDEMY-COURSES-for-FREE/projects/1)
and help us on what you want or talk to us about your proposed changes.</string>
